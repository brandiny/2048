# 2048 in Python3 (Tkinter)

2048 is a classic mobile game. This is a spinoff of 2048 for desktop using Python3's built-in tkinter framework.

## Build Instructions
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Windows</td>
        <td><code>py -m venv env && py -m pip install -r requirements.txt</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Linux</td>
        <td><code>python3 -m venv env && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Features
In addition to the traditional game mechanics, there are:
* Local highscore tables
* In-depth game statistics
* Saving and loading capabilities

The code utilises:
* Object oriented design (utilised in switching views)
* Matrix manipulation (core mechanics of the 2048 board)
* File I/O (saving and loading)
* Use of 3rd party libraries (for image manipulation)
