# 2048 in Python3 (Tkinter)

2048 is a classic mobile game. This is a spinoff of 2048 for desktop using Python3's built-in tkinter framework.

To install, run these commands while in the 2048 folder with cmd:
`python3 -m venv env && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

In addition to the regular game mechanics, there are:
* Local highscore tables
* In-depth game statistics
* Saving and loading capabilities

The code features:
* Object oriented programming (utilised in switching views)
* Matrix manipulation (core mechanics of the 2048 board)
* File I/O (saving and loading)
* Use of 3rd party libraries (for image manipulation)

If you would like more information, within the repository is a full documentation of the development process and tests used.
